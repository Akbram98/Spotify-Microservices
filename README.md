# Spotify-Microservices

## Description

Developed a backend Java API using Spring Boot to implement two microservices for managing user profiles and favorite playlists. The architecture incorporates:

- **Databases**: Utilized Neo4j for storing user profile data and interactions/relationships, and MongoDB for storing song collections.
- **Microservices**: Created RESTful API endpoints for each microservice to handle CRUD operations, facilitating seamless communication between the services.
- **Integration**: Employed Maven for compiling and running the microservices, enabling interaction through HTTP requests on specified ports.
This setup allows efficient management of user profiles and playlists, leveraging advanced database technologies to support dynamic data handling and user interaction. For more info on specific features see [here](https://github.com/Akbram98/Spotify-Microservices/blob/main/project_phase1.pdf).

## Learning Outcomes
 - Gained experience with NoSQL (MongoDB) and Graph Database (Neo4j) technologies.
 - Developed background business logic to support REST API endpoints for reading and modifying data across various databases.
 - Applied software architecture principles, focusing on the Server/Client model.
 - Implemented the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern in Java development to structure and organize application code.
 - Utilized Maven for build automation, streamlining the compilation and execution of microservices.
